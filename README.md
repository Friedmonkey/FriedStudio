## About The Project

![Screen Shot](/FriedStudioDesign.png)

I found out about code-dom which allowed to compile c# code, this gave me the idea of re making visual studio.
I knew i would never be able to make anything as good as the actual visual studio however i would be happy with just a working version, however scuffed it might be.

This project originally was named Scuffed-studio because of the bad decisions i made, and the way i've implemented certain things.

This is what it can do:
* Waste your time
* Make Winforms applications using a lacking designer and a basic script editor
* Use the designer to add controls to the form
* Resize the controls and the form to fit your needs
* Change properties of controls like the name and text
* Add On-click event to control
* Very basic script editor i didn't even make myself
* Change the output (Dll, WinExe, Exe)
* Compile and output the exe/dll
* Even tho it has other options, this really is made just for making forms

Pros:
* idk might startup faster than Visual Studio
* i *THINK* it outputs smaller files?
* idek if visual studio is open source but this one is

Cons:
* Verry buggy (you have to reselect controls when you want to change a property or itll revert the older properties)
* Scuffed (The way i've implemented certain features is unspeakable like the way namespaces work or how/where onclick events gets insertec)
* Designer generated cs file CANT be changed
* litterly no way to save a project you just have to keep it open

## Built With

My very limited mind and stolen code
(im sorry i forgot where i took the resizable controls and script editor from)
